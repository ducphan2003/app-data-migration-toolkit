  "content": "<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> Hi Chantal. What did you think of the talk, then?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> Hi Hugo. I thought it was good once I'd moved seats.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> Oh- were the people beside you chatting or something?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> {[It wasn't that. I went early so that I'd get a seat and not have to stand, but then<strong> this guy sat right in front of me and he was so tall</strong>!][21]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> {[<strong>It's hard to see through people's heads, isn't it</strong>?][21]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> {[<strong>Impossible</strong>!][21]} Anyway, to answer your question, I thought it was really interesting, especially what the speaker said about the job market.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> Me too. I mean we know we're going into a really competitive field so it's obvious that we may struggle to get work.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> That's right -- and we know we can't all have that 'dream job'.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> {[Yeah, <strong>but it looks like there's a whole range of ... areas of work that we hadn't even thought of </strong>-- like fashion journalism, for instance.][22]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> Yeah -- I wasn't expecting so many career options.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> Mmm. Overall, she had quite a strong message, didn't she?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> She did. She kept saying things like 'I know you all think this, but ...' and then she'd tell us how it really is.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> Perhaps she thinks students are a bit narrow-minded about the industry.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> <strong>It was a bit harsh, though! We know it's a tough industry</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> {[<strong>Yeah -- and we're only first years, after all. We've got a lot to learn</strong>.][23]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> Exactly. Do you think our secondary-school education should have been more career-focused?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> {[Well, we had numerous talks on careers, which was good, but <strong>none of them were very inspiring. They could have asked more people like today's speaker to talk to us</strong>.][24]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> I agree. We were told about lots of different careers -- just when we needed to be, but not by the experts who really know stuff.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> So did today's talk influence your thoughts on what career you'd like to take up in the future?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> {[<strong>Well. I promised myself that I'd go through this course and keep an open mind till the end</strong>.][25]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> {[<strong>But I think it's better to pick an area of the industry now and then aim to get better and better at it</strong>.][25]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> {[<strong>Well, I think we'll just have to differ on that issue</strong>!][25]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> One thing's for certain, though. From what she said, we'll be unpaid assistants in the industry for quite a long time.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> Mmm.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> {[<strong>I'm prepared for that, aren't you</strong>?][26]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> Actually, I'm not going to accept that view.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> Really? But she knows it's the case - and everyone else says the same.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> That doesn't mean it has to be true for me.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> OK. Well -- I hope you're right!</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> I thought the speaker's account of her first job was fascinating.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> Yeah -- she admitted she was lucky to get work being a personal dresser for a musician. She didn't even apply for the job and there she was getting paid to choose all his clothes.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> It must have felt amazing -- though she said all she was looking for back then was experience, not financial reward.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> {[Mmm. And then he was so mean, <strong>telling her she was more interested in her own appearance than his</strong>!][27-28]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> But -- she did realise he was right about that, which really made me think. I'm always considering my own clothes but now I can see you should be focusing on your client!</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> She obviously regretted losing the job.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> {[Well, as she said, <strong>she should have hidden her negative feelings about him, but she didn't</strong>.][27-28]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> It was really brave the way she picked herself up and took that job in retail. Fancy working in a shop after that!</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> Yeah -- well, she recommended we all do it at some point. I guess as a designer you'd get to find out some useful information, like how big or small the average shopper is.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> I think that's an issue for manufacturers, not designers. {[However, <strong>it would be useful to know if there's a gap in the market -- you know, an item that no one's stocking but that consumers are looking for</strong>.][29-30]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> Yeah, people don't give up searching. They also take things back to the store if they aren't right.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> {[Yeah. Imagine you worked in an expensive shop and<strong> you found out the garments sold there were being returned because they ... fell apart in the wash</strong>!][29-30]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>CHANTAL:</strong> Yeah, it would be good to know that kind of thing.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>HUGO:</strong> Yeah.</p>",
