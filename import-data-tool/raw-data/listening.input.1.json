Is that Julie Davison?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> This is Greg Preston from the Employment Agency. We met last week when you came in to enquire about office work.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Oh, that's right.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> Now we've just had some details come in of a job which might interest you.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> OK.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> {[So this is <strong>a position for a receptionist </strong>-- I believe you've done that sort of work before? ][1]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Yes, I have, I worked in a sports centre for a couple of years before I got married and had the children.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> {[Right. Well, this job's in <strong>Fordham, so not too far away for you, and it's at the medical centre there.</strong>][2]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> OK. So where exactly is that?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> {[It's quite near the station, on <strong>Chastons Road.</strong>][3]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Sorry?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> Chastons Road- that's C-H-A-S-T-O-N-S.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> OK, thanks. So what would the work involve? Dealing with enquiries from patients?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> {[Yes, and you'd also be involved in<strong> making appointments</strong>, whether face to face or on the phone. And rescheduling them if necessary. ][4]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Fine, that shouldn't be a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> {[And another of your duties would be <strong>keeping the centre's database up-to-date</strong>. Then you might have other general administrative duties as well, but those would be the main ones. ][5]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> OK.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> {[Now when the details came in, I immediately thought of you because <strong>one thing they do require is someone with experience</strong>, and you did mention your work at the sports centre when you came in to see us.][6]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Yes, in fact I enjoyed that job. Is there anything else they're looking for?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> {[Well, they say it's quite a high-pressure environment, they're always very busy, and patients are often under stress, so they want someone who can cope with that and<strong> stay calm, and at the same time be confident </strong>when interacting with the public.][7]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Well, after dealing with three children all under five, I reckon I can cope with that.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> I'm sure you can.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> And then another thing they mention is that they're looking for someone with good IT skills ...</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Not a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> So you'd be interested in following this up?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Sure. When would it start?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> {[Well, they're looking for someone from the beginning of next month, but I should tell you that <strong>this isn't a permanent job, it's temporary</strong>, so the contract would be just to the end of September. But they do say that there could be further opportunities after that. ][8]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> OK. And what would the hours be?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> Well, they want someone who can start at a quarter to eight in the morning could you manage that?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Yes, my husband would have to get the kids up and off to my mother's -- she's going to be looking after them while I'm at work. What time would I finish?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> {[<strong>One fifteen.</strong> ][9]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> {[That should work out all right. I can pick the kids up on my way home, and then I'll have the afternoon with them. Oh, one thing ... <strong>is there parking available for staff at the centre?</strong> ][10]}</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> Yes, there is. and it's also on a bus route.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Right. Well, I expect I'll have the car but it's good to know that. OK, so where do I go from here?</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> Well, if you're happy for me to do so, I'll forward your CV and references, and then the best thing would probably be for you to phone them so they can arrange for an interview.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Great. Well thank you very much.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>GREG:</strong> You're welcome. Bye now.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>JULIE:</strong> Bye.</p>",
